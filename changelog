  # 0.7.7.0
  - Standard library changes
    - `Cake`: back in to StdLib
    - `Choice`: new library (provides linear tensor)
    - `Prelude` change: generalised `pull`
    - `Vec` addition: `pushVec`
    - `Graph` bug fixes: `size` and `vertexcount` changed due to a bug fix in Granule;
  - Modules can now have headers where data constructors can be hidden on export,
	   e.g. module Cake hiding (Cake, Happy) where...
  - Fixed some bugs in `grepl` (now reads the .granule config file instead of its own)
  - `grepl` can now give the type of general expressions (if the checker can infer it)
  - Various refactorings in the compilation of constraints to SMT; fixes a bug with `Graph` lib

  # 0.7.6.0
  - LLVM compiler for a simple subset now included.
  - Various internal changes which allow effect modalities (graded possibility) to be richer.
  - Type-level sets support improved with some syntax changes, e.g., <{Read, Write}>.
  - Nat-graded monads now provided.
  - Some renaming, R and W replaced with Stdin and Stdio so as to avoid conflicts with HandleType.
  - More flexibility when combining different grading types.
  - Type holes.
  - `grin` renamed to `grepl`.
  - Various tweaks to the standard library and various bug fixes.

  # 0.7.2.0

  - Bug fixes on linearity in nested cases expressions
  - FileIO modality renamed to IO
  - Some internal reworking of security levels to match the theory

  # 0.7.0.0
  - Functions can now be written as a set of equations, and this is the best way to get dependent pattern matching
  - Various key bug fixes
  - Existentials

  # 0.6.0.5
  - IOMode is now a primitive type rather than being used primitively but being defined in a library

  # 0.6.0.4

  - Improved type support in `grin`
  - Refactoring to how ASTs are internally represented
  - Some fixes regarding consumption effects in pattern matches.

  # 0.6.0.1

  Simplified internals of kinds and coeffect types

  # 0.6.0.0
