  # 0.9.1.0 (in progress)

  # 0.9.0.0
  - Major features:
      - Uniqueness modality and mutable arrays 
        - https://granule-project.github.io/papers/esop22-paper.pdf
      - Session types with non-linear behaviours
        - https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12875
      - Granule -> Haskell compiler (grc)
      - language-server protocol
  
  - New graded modalities / improvements
    - LNL semiring (Zero, One, Many) recovers linear logic via new `hsup` operation
       to control 'push' behaviour on tensors. See: https://granule-project.github.io/papers/tlla_2021_paper11.pdf
  
    - Any semiring can now be lifted to a top-completed semiring with Ext (previously only allowed for Nat)

  - Language extensions and pragmas: See: https://github.com/granule-project/granule/wiki/Language-Extensions
    - Includes CBN interpreter as an option

  - Bug fixes:
    - Bug fixes related to sensitivity analysis
    - Bug fixes relating to derived operation copyShape
    - Improved interpreter

  - Tons of minor improvements
    - Error messages are sometimes more intuitive
    - Various additional primitives

  # 0.8.1.0
  - New semirings: `Sec` and `Set t` for some type `t` (and `SetOp t`)
  - Bug fixes related to session types
  - Some more type aliases added
  - Generic deriving coverage improved (especially with `drop`)

  # 0.8.0.0
  - --synthesise mode
  - Support for deriving simple distributive laws
  - Improved error messages
  - Improved dependent kinds support
  - Automatic case splitting and code rewriting features
  - `case` in types
  - New OOZ (One or Zero) semiring

  # 0.7.7.2
  - LLVM compiler separated into its own project to make building easier at the moment (see https://github.com/granule-project/granule-compiler-llvm).
  - Built-ins now get internally kind checked earlier, reducing the chance of us making malformed built-ins.
  - A couple of missing examples and tests added.
  - `case` expressions are now restricted to matching on non-indexed data types, with a helpful messages (this avoids pitfalls with dependent case)
  - Various small bug fixes.

  # 0.7.7.1
  - Some small fixes
  - Tweaks to improve error messages

  # 0.7.7.0
  - Standard library changes
    - `Cake`: back in to StdLib
    - `Choice`: new library (provides linear tensor)
    - `Prelude` change: generalised `pull`, `comp`, `unbox`
    - `Vec` addition: `pushVec`
    - `Graph` bug fixes: `size` and `vertexcount` changed due to a bug fix in Granule;
  - Modules can now have headers where data constructors can be hidden on export,
	   e.g. module Cake hiding (Cake, Happy) where...
  - Fixed some bugs in `grepl` (now reads the .granule config file instead of its own)
  - `grepl` can now give the type of general expressions (if the checker can infer it)
  - Various refactorings in the compilation of constraints to SMT; fixes a bug with `Graph` lib

  # 0.7.6.0
  - LLVM compiler for a simple subset now included.
  - Various internal changes which allow effect modalities (graded possibility) to be richer.
  - Type-level sets support improved with some syntax changes, e.g., <{Read, Write}>.
  - Nat-graded monads now provided.
  - Some renaming, R and W replaced with Stdin and Stdio so as to avoid conflicts with HandleType.
  - More flexibility when combining different grading types.
  - Type holes.
  - `grin` renamed to `grepl`.
  - Various tweaks to the standard library and various bug fixes.

  # 0.7.2.0
  - Ability to include additional predicates in type signatures
  - More pervasive unicode support
  - Support fewer type annotations
  - Literate mode for LaTeX/Granule files
  - Integers can be linearly consumed in patterns
  - Some bug fixes

  # 0.7.1.0
  - Various improvements to error reporting
  - New features for allowing interacting between coeffects due to nested unboxing
  - Bug fixes on linearity in nested cases expressions
  - FileIO modality renamed to IO
  - Some internal reworking of security levels to match the theory

  # 0.7.0.0
  - Functions can now be written as a set of equations, and this is the best way to get dependent pattern matching
  - Various key bug fixes
  - Existentials

  # 0.6.0.5
  - IOMode is now a primitive type rather than being used primitively but being defined in a library

  # 0.6.0.4

  - Improved type support in `grin`
  - Refactoring to how ASTs are internally represented
  - Some fixes regarding consumption effects in pattern matches.

  # 0.6.0.0

  Granule REPL added, called 'grin'

  # 0.5.5.7

  Session type duality and fork, forkRep, send, recv, close primitives.
